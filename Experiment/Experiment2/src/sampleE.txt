In the animation industry, cartoon videos are produced from hand drawings of expert animators using a complex and precise procedure. To draw each frame of an animation video manually would consume tremendous time, thus leading to a prohibitively high cost. In practice, the animation producers usually replicate one drawing two or three times to reduce the cost, which results in the actual low frame rate of animation videos. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop computational algorithms to interpolate the intermediate animation frames automatically.
In recent years, video interpolation has made great progress on natural videos. However, in animations, existing video interpolation methods are not able to produce satisfying in-between frames. An example from the film Children Who Chase Lost Voices is illustrated in Figure 1, where the current state-of-the-art methods fail to generate a piece of complete luggage due to the incorrect motion estimation, which is shown in the lower-left corner of the image. The challenges here stem from the two unique characteristics of animation videos: 1) First, cartoon images consist of explicit sketches and lines, which split the image into segments of smooth color pieces. Pixels in one segment are similar, which yields insufficient textures to match the corresponding pixels between two frames and hence increases the difficulty to predict accurate motions. 2) Second, cartoon animations use exaggerated expressions in pursuit of artistic effects, which result in non-linear and extremely large motions between adjacent frames. Two typical cases are depicted in Figure 2 (a) and (b) which illustrate these challenges respectively. Due to these difficulties mentioned above, video interpolation in animations remains a challenging task.
